	<h1>Owen DeVries</h1>
	<p>Owen de Vries, Founder and CEO of FD9 Group, grew up traveling with his family and has lived in numerous countries including New Zealand, Indonesia, and Turkey. Prior to his fashion career, Owen was involved in the hospitality industry and received his Bachelor’s degree in Hospitality Management. One of his first experiences in fashion was working for Aldina Moda’s Hilmi Bulbul, where he learned the ins and outs of the business and was inspired to move to California to continue his education at The Fashion Institution of Design & Merchandising.</p>
	<p>Upon graduation, Owen founded FD9 Group with the goal of building a well-respected international fashion house that specialized in identifying and nurturing emerging talents within the industry. He is a firm believer in the creative spirit and understands the dedication required to build successful brands.  “I am thrilled to say that there is nothing more exciting than being part of these successes. Never give up, stay ambitious, and remember that your best work is a reflection of your personality. FD9 Group’s mantra is the same as mine: stay innovative but most importantly stay true to your own imagination."</p>
