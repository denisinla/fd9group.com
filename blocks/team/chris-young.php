	<p>Christian Young hails from Los Angeles and shares a love for world travel.  He jokingly calls himself a “foodie” even though he’ll enjoy a Mcdonalds double double as much as a kobe steak from CUT.  Although he is no self-proclaimed fashionista he has always had a keen eye for fine design and the consumerist want.  With a skillset in operations, Christian has done everything from practicing entertainment law to creating an “exotic vehicle futures” equity fund.   Having started and sold three ventures since he was 19, Christian Young is no stranger to boostrapping startups and being innovative and creative on small budgets with new and creative companies.  When asked how he does it, he gives deference to his legal training which has given him a logical and analytical big-picture view – lending to better actionable intelligence.  It also helps that from a young age, Christian grew up in an entrepreneurial family.  His father built a startup to a $250M company in the personal protection sector and his mother created a chain of health food stores, both businesses which Christian spent considerable time working at in his younger years.</p>
	<p>His first foray into fashion occurred during his formative years in law school, and although his first attempt never flourished he found himself building up knowledge of the industry in between his other entrepreneurial ventures.  Combining his operations experience with his love of fashion, Christian intends for FD9 Group to be the culmination of his entrepreneurial spirit and personal passion.</p>
