					<h2>Chris Young - Co-Founder & President</h2>
					<p>Christian Young hails from Los Angeles and shares a love for world travel.  He jokingly calls himself a “foodie” even though he’ll enjoy an In-N-Out double double as much as a kobe steak from CUT.  Although he is no self-proclaimed fashionista he has always had a keen eye for fine design and the consumerist want.  With a skillset in operations, Christian has done everything from practicing entertainment law to creating an “exotic vehicle futures” equity fund. Having started and sold three ventures since he was 19, Christian Young is no stranger to boostrapping startups and being innovative and creative on small budgets with new and creative companies.</p><p>His first foray into fashion occurred during his formative years in law school, and although his first attempt never flourished he found himself building up knowledge of the industry in between his other entrepreneurial ventures.  Combining his operations experience with his love of fashion, Christian intends for FD9 Group to be the culmination of his entrepreneurial spirit and personal passion.</p>
