				<p>FD9 Group originated from The Netherlands, where Owen de Vries founded the fashion group with a mission to create and deploy successful fashion industry startups. Together with Co-Founder Chris Young, FD9 Group has become what is Los Angeles’s first fashion incubator. 
 				</p>
				<p>FD9 Group started operations in late 2012 and since its first round of fundraising has created BesoBeso, Coordinates Collection and the e-commerce platform Rarelook. Through its internal resources, FD9 Group has the the ability to create apparel and accessories companies from scratch, with deep connections established in product creation, development, marketing, and wholesale deployment.

					With offices strategically located in the middle of Los Angeles between Silicon Beach, and the manufacturing nucleus -Downtown LA, FD9 Group felt that it was necessary for the location of the office to reflect the mission and strategy of the company.  “At the time given we believed it was a centered location between technology on the west side and fashion on the east, which is exactly our business model, bringing fashion and technology closer together” said Owen de Vries, CEO and Founder of FD9 Group.</p>

					<p>“Los Angeles has in the past few years been at the center of fashiontech names like Beachmint, Nastygal, and Hautelook, and with Santa Monica and Hollywood being the center of a growing technology space, Los Angeles made the most logical sense.” </p>  

					<p>Although the fashion incubator idea is fairly new, FD9 Group is determined to create and develop well-recognized and internationally known brands and platforms. </p>

					<p>“We have come a long way since we started, it was not always easy, solving day to day problems and trying to systematically operationalize what is essentially a creative and artistic process”, Chris said about the problems of developing the new concept of a Fashion Incubator.  
						</p>
					<p>FD9 Group now has two brands, BesoBeso and Coordinates Collection, both in the jewelry vertical, and is expected to mature both brands before seeking next round fundraising for scale out.  About the success of the incubator, Chris quoted, “There’s a lot of testing that’s been going on with our brands, and constant pivots, but the revenue growth and steady forward progress assures us that we are doing something good here”. </p>

					<p>FD9 Group also has a platform currently in its beginning phases.  Aptly named, RARELOOK, the platform is a unique e-commerce site conceived to bring exclusive and limited quantity versions of existing products to the market.  Owen stated, “This may be our most ambitious and biggest project so far, and we are all very excited to launch this towards the end of 2013.  It is a unique platform that aims to bring exclusivity to the next level.”</p>

					<p>FD9 Group expects that at the end of this year to be accepting new brands and ideas for its platform. For more information on current projects please visit <a href="/portfolio">Portfolio</a>
