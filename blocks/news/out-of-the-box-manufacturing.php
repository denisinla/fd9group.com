				<p>FD9 Group utilizes the newest technologies and spends significant amounts of time in R&D to ensure quality product and unique design.  Its current brands BesoBeso, along with Coordinates Collection, are both fast fashion- and have manufacturing and design requirements in order to operate in their respective business sectors.  In order to ensure that production pieces are on trend the pre-production to production process has been streamlined by FD9 to take less than 6 weeks from beginning to end.  With a significant catalogue of niche suppliers and specific skillset manufacturers, FD9 Group can design and produce quality and on-trend accessories in a fast fashion manner that would normally only be achievable by larger cap companies.

					FD9 attributes its success to its team’s willingness to think out of the box and to develop innovative solutions to a traditionally staid industry.  Whereas most traditional jewelry production starts with a wax model obtained from a mold and made into an investment shell, FD9 Group chooses to utilize 3D printer made molds to streamline and quicken the design process and reduce pre-production overhead.  Furthermore, stress loading on jewelry is tested within CAD design software to determine longevity of pieces and to ensure lasting quality.  Out-of-the-box thinking continues in FD9 Group’s jewelry production process.  For some pieces, FD9 Group has programmed and re-purposed commercial machinery usually reserved for the aerospace industry to be used for jewelry production.

					FD9 Group’s attention to manufacturing detail and willingness to invest in R&D also shows returns in other areas.  While most jewelry made in brass or bronze has a propensity to crack or tarnish, FD9 Group has worked closely with its manufacturers to develop its own proprietary brass types that encourage corrosion resistance via the add-in of aluminum – furthermore, pieces are applied a supplementary corrosion resistant coatings to ensure that even at affordable price points FD9 Group developed jewelry pieces maintain a high level of quality and durability.
