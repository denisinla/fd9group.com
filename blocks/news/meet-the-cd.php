					<p>At FD9 Group, we are constantly looking for new and innovative ways to change the fashion landscape and no one understands this more than our Creative Director, Erin Blase. As our Creative Director, Erin represents the creative mind behind BesoBeso, our first vertically integrated monthly jewelry platform.

						<h2>WHERE DID YOU GROW UP AND WHERE DO YOU LIVE NOW?</h2>
						<p>
I grew up in St. Louis, Missouri and spent time living in Chicago and New York City before making LA my home base.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE CREATIVE DIRECTOR?</h2>

<p>My job requires a lot of collaboration and communication because everything starts at this level. A majority of my time is spent finding designers to collaborate with, determining and communicating the design direction for the collection, and then focusing on making their aesthetic work for the BesoBeso girl. I also work on pre-production with our Production Manager to ensure the jewelry is made exactly how I want it and one of my favorite parts of the job is testing our samples. I’ll wear them constantly and test the fit, comfort, and really just bang them around to see if they will break. Anything that gets tons of compliments and doesn’t break gets to go into production and passes my test!</p>
<h2>HOW AND WHERE DO YOU FIND YOUR DESIGN INSPRIATIONS?</h2>
<p>Most of my design inspiration comes from the places I’ve lived or traveled to but I’m guided mostly by intuition when approving designs. I’m also very fascinated by the unknown…things like the bottom of the deepest lake or abandoned subway stations and underground tunnels. But I’m consistently inspired by architecture, (right now I’m influenced by Eero Saarinen and Santiago Calatrava) and I feel like jewelry is similar in that it is permanent and people can have an emotional response to it. My parents, especially my Dad, taught me the importance of great design and that appreciation is always consistent in my work.</p> 
<h2>WHAT IS YOUR OVERALL CREATIVE DIRECTION FOR BESOBESO?</h2>
<p>For me, the overarching goal for everything I do with BesoBeso is to create high quality pieces that utilize good design and are sold for a price you can justify. I really think that is how everything should be-anyone can make a cool piece of jewelry but it can turn your hand green in a day or break. I know it sounds like a cliché but I truly want our jewelry to last and for people to love it. That really guides everything I do with the brand.
